            q: "What is a Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI)?",
            a: "A PDI is a thorough check of your new car before delivery. It ensures there are no scratches, dents, mechanical issues, or missing features."
        },
        {
            q: "Why should I get an expert PDI?",
            a: "Even new cars can have transport damage, paint issues, or missing accessories. A professional PDI ensures your investment is safe before signing the final papers."
        },
        {
            q: "How long does a PDI take?",
            a: "A standard 400 point inspection usually takes 1–2 hours, depending on the car and dealership access."
        },
        {
            q: "Can I do the PDI myself?",
            a: "You can check basics, but experts use tools to detect hidden issues like electronic faults, OBD errors, and repainting."
        },
        {
            q: "Do I need to book the PDI in advance?",
            a: "Yes. Dealerships require scheduling, and inspectors coordinate to ensure inspection before delivery."
        },
        {
            q: "How much does a PDI cost?",
            a: "Standard cars starts at ₹1,499 and luxury cars at ₹2,499 with a full inspection report."
        },
        {
            q: "What do I get after the inspection?",
            a: "You receive a detailed checklist report with photos and identified issues before accepting delivery."
        },
        {
            q: "What is a Used Car Inspection (PPI)?",
            a: "A Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI) is a comprehensive inspection of a used car before purchase. It helps identify hidden mechanical, electrical, structural, or accidental damage so you can make an informed buying decision."
        },
        {
            q: "Why should I inspect a used car before buying?",
            a: "Many used cars may have hidden accident repairs, odometer tampering, engine issues, suspension wear, or flood damage. A professional inspection can save you from costly repairs after purchase."
        },
        {
            q: "How many checkpoints are covered in a used car inspection?",
            a: "Our inspection includes over 300 checkpoints covering the engine, transmission, suspension, brakes, tyres, electrical systems, body panels, paint, chassis, interior, and a road test where applicable."
        },
        {
            q: "Do you provide an OBD diagnostic scan?",
            a: "Yes. We perform an OBD scan on compatible vehicles to detect hidden fault codes, engine warnings, ABS, airbag issues, and other electronic problems that may not be visible during a physical inspection."
        },
        {
            q: "Can you inspect cars at dealerships and individual sellers?",
            a: "Yes. We inspect used cars at authorised dealerships, multi-brand showrooms, and private seller locations, subject to seller approval."
        },
        {
            q: "Will I receive a detailed inspection report?",
            a: "Yes. After the inspection, you'll receive a detailed report with photographs, observations, defects found, and our recommendations to help you negotiate or avoid a problematic vehicle."
        },
        {
            q: "Can your report help negotiate the car price?",
            a: "Absolutely. Many buyers use our inspection findings to negotiate repairs or reduce the purchase price based on the vehicle's actual condition."
        },
        {
            q: "Do you inspect luxury and premium cars?",
            a: "Yes. We inspect luxury brands including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover, and other premium vehicles using specialised inspection procedures."
        },
        {
            q: "Which areas of Pune do you cover?",
            a: "We provide new car PDI and used car inspection services across Pune, including Baner, Hinjewadi, Wakad, Kharadi, Hadapsar, Kothrud, Aundh, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Magarpatta, and nearby areas."
        },
        {
            q: "Can I book an inspection on short notice?",
            a: "Yes. Subject to inspector availability, we can often arrange same-day or next-day inspections. Advance booking is recommended to secure your preferred slot."
